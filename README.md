### independence_testing

Code for HSIC-based large-scale independence tests. The methods are described in:

Q. Zhang, S. Filippi, A. Gretton, and D. Sejdinovic, __Large-Scale Kernel Methods for Independence Testing__, _ArXiv e-prints:1606.07892_, 2016.

For an example use of the code, demonstrating how to run an HSIC-based large-scale independence test on either simulated data or data loaded from a file, see ExampleHSIC.py.
